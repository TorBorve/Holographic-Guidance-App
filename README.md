## Environment setup

1. install Unity Hub and current Unity version (2020.3.30f1)

https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download

It will tell you if you're opening a project with the wrong Unity version and will also let you install the correct version automatically. 
(For this you need a Unity account. dk if you can get around this with a direct installation.)

2. Install .NET

Desktop App

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime

3. (Only for initial setup, not if you only clone the project.) Download the MRTK Feature Tool. 

It lets you organize your Unity Project, install all MRTK packages and additional stuff that we might need. (e.g. for Azure)

Here's how it works: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool
