## Environment setup

1. install Unity Hub and current Unity version (2020.3.30f1)

https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download

It will tell you if you're opening a project with the wrong Unity version and will also let you install the correct version automatically. 
(For this you need a Unity account. dk if you can get around this with a direct installation.)

2. Install the MRTK Feature Tool. 

It lets you organize your Unity Project, install all MRTK packages and additional stuff that we might need. (e.g. for Azure)
