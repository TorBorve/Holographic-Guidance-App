# 4D Holographic Tutorials

### Abstract
In recent years, augmented and virtual reality devices experienced significant improvements in usability and processing power, directly leading to increased usage in industrial settings. In this paper, we present a novel application to enable diverse users to create 4D Holographic Tutorials for the HoloLens 2. To the author's best knowledge, no previous work exists trying to achieve a similar result. We focused on providing an easy to use user-interface, which allows users to create and watch tutorials step-by-step. Not only does it allow creating tutorials for specific locations, but it also provides the functionality to use the same tutorial for new locations. We describe the design of core features and publish the code as open-source software. To show the prevalent usability, a user study qualitatively measures the user experience. Given the broad domain of potential applications and research avenues, we lay a foundation for future work to create applications of this technology to diverse training scenarios.
