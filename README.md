## Environment setup

1. install Unity Hub and current Unity version (2020.3.30f1)

https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download

It will tell you if you're opening a project with the wrong Unity version and will also let you install the correct version automatically. 
(For this you need a Unity account. dk if you can get around this with a direct installation.)

2. Install .NET

Desktop App

3. Install Visual Studio Community edition 

I'm not sure how restrictive the choice of version is. I had the 2022 version installed which was enough for the Unity2020 installation, but the Unity2019 installation that is used to open isaaks repo triggered the VS install of 2019. Don't know if this doesn't matter..

4. (Only for initial setup, not if you only clone the project.) Download the MRTK Feature Tool. 

It lets you organize your Unity Project, install all MRTK packages and additional stuff that we might need. (e.g. for Azure)
